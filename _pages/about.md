# About Me

A seasoned Software Engineer specializing in system architecture and scalable solutions. With extensive experience at MakeMyTrip, I've built and maintained high-performance systems serving millions of users daily.

My technical expertise spans backend development, distributed systems, and performance optimization. I'm passionate about solving complex engineering challenges and continuously exploring emerging technologies that enhance system resilience and efficiency.

Beyond coding, I enjoy sharing my insights through technical writing and contributing to open-source projects. My approach combines pragmatic problem-solving with a deep commitment to maintainable, well-designed code.

I'm currently focused on [your current focus area - e.g., "building scalable cloud infrastructures", "exploring microservice architectures", etc.], and always open to discussing innovative solutions to difficult technical problems.
